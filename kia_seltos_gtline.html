            <p>Like the Creta, the Seltos also has the square and upright look that Indians love. The Seltos is also a bit bigger than the Hyundai Creta. It is 45mm longer, 20mm wider and the wheelbase is longer by 20mm too. However, in terms of height, it is less than the Creta. This is because the Seltos is built on a new platform on which the next generation Creta, due to be launched in 2020, has also been made.</p>
            <p>Premium, that’s how the cabin of the Seltos feels. The cabin design, the choice of colour combinations, the quality of materials and the finish make it look like it costs well over Rs 20 lakh. Cleverly, all the touch points - like the steering wheel,  the gear lever, the elbow pad on the door and the crashpad on the dash - have soft-touch leather on it. The leather-wrap for the flat-bottomed steering wheel deserves a special mention as it wouldn’t be out of place on an Audi either. On that note, the quality of the steering-mounted buttons and the silver finish used around the centre console felt worthy of a luxury car. Other than this, Kia has made use of hard plastics which undoubtedly will help keep the price in check. Thankfully, everything is designed sensibly. The aircon vents are large and you can shut each one as well and the armrest between the front seats is well placed too. </p>
            <p>The Seltos is offered dual-airbags with ABS and EBD as standard. Only the GTX and GTX+ variants come with six airbags. These variants also get Electronic Stability Control (ESC), Vehicle Stability Management (VSM) and hill hold. Yes, you can’t have this with the diesel engine or the 1.5 litre petrol engine either. The diesel also misses out on the 360-degree surround view camera. Thankfully, the optional front parking sensors and tyre pressure monitoring system are offered on the Tech Line’s HTX and HTX+ variants.</p>
            <p>Kia is offering six engine and transmission combinations on the Seltos. All engines on the Seltos are already BS6 compliant and Kia says that they have been tested on BS4 fuel too. The top-of-the-line petrol engine is a 140PS 1.4 litre turbocharged unit which is available with a 6-speed manual transmission or a 7-speed dual-clutch (automatic) transmission. In manual guise, the engine feels energetic for highway use, yet easy to live with in the city. The clutch is light, the engine is responsive from under 1500rpm and when you want to accelerate fast, it revs quickly to deliver a strong punch. As expected of a petrol motor, it is smooth and quiet too. </p>
            <p>The Seltos will be available in more than 16 variants. Kia will use a dual-trim strategy with the Tech Line meant to appeal to family buyers and the GT Line to the more enthusiastic audiences. The lineup includes HTE (for Energy), HTK (Klass), HTK+, HTX (eXciting) and HTX+. The GT line will skip the GTE variant and stick to the GTK , GTK+, GTX and GTX+ variants. </p>
            <p>With a striking interior and exterior design, host of feel-good features and multiple powertrain options, Kia seems to have cut no corners in equipping its first offering for India. The Seltos is the car to wait for if you’re planning to buy a compact SUV in India right now.</p>
