              <p> Tata has increased the prices of the Nexon EV by Rs 25,000 across all its variants.</p>
              <p>The electric sub-4m SUV is now priced from Rs 14.54 lakh to Rs 17.15 lakh (ex-showroom pan-India).</p>
              <p>The carmaker offers the EV in three trims: XM, XZ+, and XZ+ Lux. It’s also available in select Dark variants.</p>
              <p>The Nexon EV uses Tata’s Ziptron EV powertrain technology, packed with a 30.2kWh lithium-ion battery supply with a claimed range of 312km. It gets an 8-year standard warranty and an IP67 waterproof battery pack. The electric motor has a performance rating of 129PS and 245Nm. It is about to get an update soon which will add a bigger battery pack for the electric SUV, thereby increasing its claimed range.</p> 
              <p>It takes 60 minutes to charge the EV from 0-80 percent using a fast DC charger. Whereas, it takes 8 eight hours using a small home box wall charger to charge the electric SUV from 20 to 80 percent. </p> 
              <p> Features onboard include a semi-digital instrument cluster (with a 7-inch TFT display), auto AC, auto headlights, a sunroof, a 7-inch touchscreen infotainment system, and connected car technology.</p>
              <p>Safety equipment comprises dual front airbags, cornering stability control, and ISOFIX child seat anchors.</p>
              <p>It currently doesn’t have any direct rival in its space, though it will take on the upcoming Mahindra XUV300 EV and MG’s sub-Rs 15 lakh EV.</p>
