            <p>The Range Rover is the most luxurious SUV built by Land Rover and is the flagship of their SVO line-up as well. This is the mid-life MY2018 upgrade for the Range Rover which was launched back in 2015.</p>
            <p>The MY 2018 Rangie takes cues from the newly-launched Range Rover Velar with the raked and sleeker grille, matrix LED headlamps, new tail lamps and chunkier bumpers with the exhausts now integrated into them. It is offered in both versions – the standard and the long wheelbase with the latter offering more than 100mm of additional knee-room for the rear passenger.</p>
            <p>Inside, you now get the Touch Pro Duo infotainment system and a waterproof activity key. However, the biggest change are new seats which are now wider with multiple control functions available at the touch of a button. Obviously the cabin is wrapped in the choicest of leather and gets the premium wooden veneers for the luxurious feel. It gets all the bells and whistles including reclining rear-seats for added comfort.</p>
            <p>You get a variety of engine options like a 3.0-litre V6 petrol, a 4.4-litre diesel V8 and the 5.0-litre supercharged V8. All models get a ZF eight-speed AT and the latest version of Land Rover’s terrain response system. Known globally for its off-roading prowess, both versions also boast of top notch approach and departure angles for high levels of off-roading capabilities.</p>
            <p>The Range Rover range rivals the likes of the Porsche Cayenne and other super luxury SUVs like the Bentley Bentayga, Mercedes-Benz G-Wagon and the Mercedes-Benz GLS63 AMG.</p>
            <p>Land Rover Range Rover price starts at ₹ 2.11 Crore and goes upto ₹ 4.38 Crore. The price of Petrol version for Range Rover ranges between ₹ 2.11 Crore - ₹ 4.38 Crore and the price of Diesel version for Range Rover ranges between ₹ 2.11 Crore - ₹ 4.38 Crore.</p>
