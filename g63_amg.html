        <h1>G63 AMG</h1>

        <div class="intro">
            <p>The Mercedes-Benz G-Class has finally entered its second generation. One of the longest running name plates for the German automaker, it is literally the blueprint of how to combine luxury with ruggedness and has been in production for over 70 years now.</p>
            <p>We in India will get the G-Class in the form of the G63 AMG. The previous iteration of this car came to India in 2013 and this one will be launched here on October 5. The boxy lines have been retained as has been the large engine line up, albeit with subtle hints of the modern Mercedes language to bring this iconic vehicle to the modern generation.</p>
            <p>Although the new G-Class looks strikingly familiar on the outside, a closer inspection reveals subtle updates that give it a more refined look, without shedding any of its rugged appeal. It is just as boxy and tall as the outgoing car. This trend extends to the interior design too, where the updates make the cabin look more contemporary.</p>
            <p>Mercedes has fitted the G63 with a 4.0-liter twin-turbo V8. In the AMG state of tune, the G63 produces 577bhp 850 Nm of torque. And it’s not just a power bump. Fuel efficiency goes up too, thanks to cylinder deactivation technology and the addition of a 9-speed automatic instead of the outgoing model's 7-speed. The new G63 is also considerably lighter than its predecessor, though a final figure hasn't been announced.</p>
            <P>It has a 0-100kmph time of 4.4 seconds and will go on to hit a top speed of almost 240kmph. AMG has also significantly enhanced the suspension and the design of the G63, which is also helped along by the new G-Class's independent double wishbone suspension at the front and five-link setup at the rear. The G63 also sports adaptive dampers and coil springs at each corner. It also has additional transverse stabilizers at both ends to reduce body roll.</P>
            <p>We expect that Mercedes-Benz will price the G63 around Rs 2 crore. It will take on the likes of the Jeep Grand Cherokee SRT, Porsche Cayenne Turbo, Lamborghini Urus, BMW X5 M and the Range Rover Sport.</p>
