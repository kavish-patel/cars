            <p>Starting out as a ride sharing company, Ola has grown into a large organisation. The company’s vehicular division, Ola Electric, was established in 2020 and has gone about establishing itself in a big manner. It first acquired Dutch firm Etergo, on whose AppScooter it based its first electric scooter the S1. To produce the S1, Ola is making perhaps India’s largest two-wheeler manufacturing facility in Tamil Nadu and to facilitate its mass adoption, it will invest in creating a vast network of fast charging stations (which will be called the Hypercharger network).</p>
            <p>Scooters - Ola offers just a single scooter: the S1. The scooter comes in two different variants, standard and Pro, with the latter getting a larger battery, more power and extra fancy features like cruise control and voice commands. Both scooters though have completely keyless functionality, as they are operated by a proximity sensor and a key code.</p>
            <p>Ola is keen on providing more sustainable mobility solutions to Indian customers. Hence, the S1 will be followed up with a slightly more affordable electric scooter, an electric motorcycle and perhaps even an electric car.</p>
