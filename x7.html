        <div class="intro">
            <p>The flagship Sports Activity Vehicle (SAV) from BMW, the X7 is available in two variants - xDrive30d Design Pure Excellence Signature (locally produced) and the xDrive40i (CBU). The three-row SUV gets a new design language, host of luxury and off-road hardware.            </p>
            <p>The exceptionally large kidney grille lends it a family face. On the other hand, the BMW Laser Light technology with blue X-shaped elements give it an aggressive look. Meanwhile, the rear looks modern and elegant with slim LED lights and two-section split tailgate. The generous use of chrome elements further enhances its luxury appeal.</p>
            <p>The long doors, large windows and elongated roofline give an airy cabin-feel. The vehicle has an elevated seat position for better all-round visibility. Additionally, the X7 offers abundant legroom, headroom and space for up to seven occupants. Rear-seat experience is enhanced with optional six-seat configuration including two captain-style comfort seats for the second row. Moreover, the vehicle gets automatic air conditioning with five-zone control. The large panoramic roof extends to the third row, thereby allowing dynamic light flow throughout the cabin.            </p>
            <p>The BMW X7 xDrive40i is powered by a 3.0-litre six-cylinder petrol engine that produces an output of 340bhp and maximum torque of 450Nm at 1,500 – 5,200rpm. The car accelerates from 0 -100kmph in 6.1 seconds. The BMW X7 xDrive30d is powered by a 3.0-litre six-cylinder diesel engine that produces an output of 265bhp and a maximum torque of 620Nm at 1,500 – 2,500rpm. The car accelerates from 0 -100kmph in just seven-seconds.</p>
